  1. Add cloud_control_api to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:cloud_control_api, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure cloud_control_api is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:cloud_control_api]]
        end
